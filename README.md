## Issues
Feel free to submit issues and enhancement requests.

## Contributing
Yes. Do it.

1. Fork the repository and clone it locally. 
2. Connect your local to the original ‘upstream’ repository by adding it as a remote. 
3. Pull in changes from ‘upstream’ often so that you stay up to date so that when you submit your pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely.
4. Create a branch for your edits.
5. Be clear about what problem is occurring and how someone can recreate that problem or why your feature will help. Then be equally as clear about the steps you took to make your changes.
6. Include screenshots of the before and after if your changes include differences in HTML/CSS. Drag and drop the images into the body of your pull request.
7. Contribute in the style of the project to the best of your abilities. This may mean using indents, semi colons or comments differently than you would in your own repository, but makes it easier for the maintainer to merge, others to understand and maintain in the future.
